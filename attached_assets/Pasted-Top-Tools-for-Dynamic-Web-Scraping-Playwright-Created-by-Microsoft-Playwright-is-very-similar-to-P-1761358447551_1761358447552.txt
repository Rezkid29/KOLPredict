Top Tools for Dynamic Web Scraping
Playwright

Created by Microsoft, Playwright is very similar to Puppeteer but supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, making it both cross-browser and robust for scraping JavaScript-heavy, dynamic pages.

Features advanced browser automation, stealth modes, and built-in selectors for modern Single Page Applications (SPAs).​

Selenium WebDriver

Long-standing tool for browser automation and web scraping, compatible with all major browsers.

Supports multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C#), making it highly versatile, though typically slower and heavier than Puppeteer or Playwright.​

Crawlee

A modern Node.js scraping and crawling library, built to run with Puppeteer or Playwright under the hood and featuring advanced anti-blocking, proxy support, queue management, and data extraction tools.​

Excellent for scalable projects with strong support for dealing with dynamic/rich sites.

Beautiful Soup (Python)

Used alongside Selenium for pages needing browser automation or requests/HTTPX for static content.

Provides easy HTML/XML traversal, not suitable on its own for JavaScript-heavy pages.​

Scrapy (Python)

Advanced, scalable scraping/crawling framework with support for custom middleware and data pipelines.

Best suited for static sites, but with Selenium integration or custom middleware, it can handle dynamic content.​

Octoparse and ParseHub (No-Code Tools)

Visual, point-and-click platforms that automate scraping, including handling some dynamic and JavaScript-rendered content without code.

These tools are user-friendly and good for non-developers but are less flexible for hard targets or custom flows.​

Apify SDK / Actor Platform

JavaScript-based, highly scalable scraping and automation SDK. Can run headless browsers (via Puppeteer or Playwright) on a managed cloud, ideal for large or distributed projects.​

Pyppeteer

Python port of Puppeteer for scraping dynamic JS with a Pythonic interface. Useful if your stack is primarily Python, though less up-to-date than Puppeteer itself.
