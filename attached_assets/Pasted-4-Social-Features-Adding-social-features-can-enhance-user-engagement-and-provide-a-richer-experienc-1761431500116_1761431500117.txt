4. Social Features
Adding social features can enhance user engagement and provide a richer experience. Here are some specific implementations you could consider:

User Following: Allow users to follow other users and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) on the platform. This means users can easily track the activities of those they are interested in. You'll want to create a follow model and API endpoints that manage the following relationships such as:

POST /api/follow/:userId to follow another user.
DELETE /api/unfollow/:userId to unfollow a user.
Activity Feed: Introduce an activity feed that showcases the recent actions of followed users and KOLs (e.g., new bets placed, notifies about KOL performance changes). This can be implemented by subscribing to updates via WebSocket or periodically fetching the latest activity.

Messaging: Consider adding direct messaging between users to facilitate strategy sharing or discussions about market performance.

User Profiles: Users could have a profile page displaying stats, achievements, and followed KOLs. Profiles may also feature past market performance and feedback from other users to lend credibility.

6. Community Forum
A community forum allows users to discuss relevant topics and engage with each other directly. Hereâ€™s how to implement this:

Forum Structure: You can create different topics and threads for discussions around KOLs, market strategies, or general queries regarding betting. Utilize a nested comment system.

Moderation Tools: Implement moderation capabilities such as upvotes/downvotes, report buttons for inappropriate content, and moderation roles to manage discussions.

API Implementation:

Create Thread: POST /api/forum/threads to allow users to create new threads.
Post Comment: POST /api/forum/comments to allow replies on threads.
Fetch Threads: GET /api/forum/threads to retrieve available discussions.
User Engagement: Encourage users to participate by occasionally highlighting popular or insightful threads on your main interface.

10. Tutorials & FAQs
Including a tutorial and FAQ section improves user retention and satisfaction, especially for new users. Here are ways to execute this:

Tutorial Section: Create video or text-based tutorials that guide new users through platform features, betting mechanics, and how to interpret KOL data. Ensure these tutorials are easily accessible from the main interface.

FAQ Database: Offer a dynamic FAQ section where users can search for common issues or questions. Each question can be expandable to show detailed answers. Use an API endpoint to manage FAQs:

GET /api/faqs to retrieve FAQs from the server.
Interactive Help: Implement a chatbot or help assistant that provides real-time guidance to users. This could be integrated using a service like Intercom or built in-house.
