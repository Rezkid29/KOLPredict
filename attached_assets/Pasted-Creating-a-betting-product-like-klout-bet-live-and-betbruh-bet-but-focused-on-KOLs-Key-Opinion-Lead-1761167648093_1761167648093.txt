Creating a betting product like klout.bet/live and betbruh.bet but focused on KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) on KolScan involves combining elements of prediction markets, social influence metrics, and real-time data from KolScan.
Key Features to Include KOL Profiles & Metrics Integration: Pull real-time data on KOLs from KolScan API to show influence metrics, trends, and activity.
Prediction/Betting Markets on KOL Performance: Users bet on outcomes related to KOL metrics—e.g., growth in followers, engagement rates, campaign success metrics.
Odds Generation: Use AI or statistical models to generate odds based on historical KOL performance data and external factors.
User Wallet & Transactions: Users can deposit, place bets, and receive payouts.
Leaderboard & Social Features: Rankings for bettors and KOLs to encourage interaction and competition.
Compliance & Security: Ensure proper regulatory measures and data protection for users and transactions.
Development Approach Data Integration: Connect with KolScan to fetch and update KOL data automatically.
Backend: Odds calculation engine plus bet management and user management.
Frontend: User-friendly dashboards to view KOL data, place bets, track outcomes.
Rapid MVP: Initially focus on core betting on KOL metrics without complex financial transactions, scaling up over time.
