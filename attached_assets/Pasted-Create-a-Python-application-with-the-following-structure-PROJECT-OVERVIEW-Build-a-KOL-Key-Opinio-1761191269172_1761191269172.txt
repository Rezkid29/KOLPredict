Create a Python application with the following structure:

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Build a KOL (Key Opinion Leader) prediction market generator that scrapes crypto trader data and creates randomized prediction markets. Must comply with X API free tier limits (3 user lookups per 15 minutes).

REQUIRED FILES:

1. scrape_kol_leaderboard_structured.py
   - Scrape https://kolscan.io/leaderboard using Selenium
   - Extract: Rank, Username, X Handle, Wins/Losses, SOL Gain, USD Gain
   - Output: Timestamped CSV file (kol_leaderboard_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv)
   - Must handle rank 1 with trophy emoji (üèÜ 1)
   - Use stealth browser options to avoid detection

2. kol_market_generator.py
   - Read latest CSV from scraper
   - Generate 5 random prediction markets from these types:
     a) Rank Flippening: "Will KOL A rank higher than KOL B tomorrow?"
     b) Profit Streak: "Will KOL X have positive USD gain tomorrow?"
     c) Follower Growth: "Will KOL X gain Y followers in Z days?" (uses X API)
   - Cache X API follower data for 24 hours in kol_follower_cache.json
   - Track rate limits: max 3 X API user lookups per 15 minutes
   - Save market data to market_cache_{id}.json for future resolution
   - 70% of markets should NOT use X API to preserve rate limits

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Dependencies:
- selenium
- pandas
- tweepy (for X API)
- beautifulsoup4 (optional fallback)
- chromedriver-autoinstaller (for Replit Chrome setup)

Environment Variables (for X API integration):
- X_API_KEY
- X_API_SECRET
- X_ACCESS_TOKEN
- X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

Key Features:
- Rate limit tracking with RateLimitTracker class
- 24-hour follower count caching system
- Graceful degradation (works without X API credentials)
- Market data persistence for resolution checking
- Timestamped output files

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:

CSV Format (from scraper):
Rank,Username,X Handle,Wins/Losses,SOL Gain,USD Gain
üèÜ 1,Cupsey,2fg5QD,28/23,+123.01 Sol,"($22,396.6)"
2,Insyder,G3g1CK,19/61,+56.42 Sol,"($10,271.6)"

Market Output Format:
ID: rank_flip_20251022_223054
Question: Will Cupsey rank higher than Insyder on tomorrow's kolscan.io leaderboard?
End Time: 2025-10-23 23:00:00
Resolution: Tomorrow's kolscan.io CSV comparison
X API Required: False

EXECUTION FLOW:
1. Run scraper to generate CSV
2. Run market generator to create 5 markets
3. Markets cache initial state for future resolution
4. Respect X API free tier limits throughout

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must comply with X API free tier: 3 user lookups per 15 minutes
- Must handle missing X handles gracefully
- Must cache API responses to minimize requests
- Must work without X API credentials (degraded mode)

Please implement both files with proper error handling, rate limiting, and caching mechanisms.
