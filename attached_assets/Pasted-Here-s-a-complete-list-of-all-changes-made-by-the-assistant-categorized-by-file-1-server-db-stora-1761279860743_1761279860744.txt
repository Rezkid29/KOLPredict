* Fix P&L Calculation for Sells
    * Updated the logic to calculate profit based on total original investment instead of average cost per share.
    * Added debug logging to help diagnose P&L calculation issues.
* Changes:â€¨sharesAmount = params.amount;â€¨betAmount = calculatePayoutForSell(params.amount, params.position, yesPool, noPool);â€¨â€¨// Calculate profit: payout - total original investmentâ€¨// Total investment = shares sold Ã— average cost per shareâ€¨const totalInvestment = params.amount * averageCost;â€¨profit = betAmount - totalInvestment;â€¨â€¨console.log(`\nðŸ’° SELL P&L CALCULATION:`);â€¨console.log(` Shares sold: ${params.amount}`);â€¨console.log(` Average cost per share: ${averageCost.toFixed(4)}`);â€¨console.log(` Total investment: ${totalInvestment.toFixed(2)}`);â€¨console.log(` Payout received: ${betAmount.toFixed(2)}`);â€¨console.log(` Profit/Loss: ${profit.toFixed(2)} (${profit >= 0 ? 'PROFIT' : 'LOSS'})\n`);â€¨â€¨// Validate calculationâ€¨if (isNaN(betAmount) || !isFinite(betAmount) || betAmount < 0) {â€¨
* Fix Undefined Variable References
    * Corrected references toÂ userId,Â marketId, andÂ positionÂ to referenceÂ params.userId,Â params.marketId, andÂ params.positionÂ instead.
* Changes:â€¨// For new positions, use actual cost per shareâ€¨const costPerShare = params.amount / sharesAmount;â€¨await tx.insert(positions).values({â€¨userId: params.userId,â€¨marketId: params.marketId,â€¨position: params.position,â€¨shares: sharesAmount.toFixed(2),â€¨averagePrice: costPerShare.toFixed(4),â€¨});â€¨
