ðŸš¨ Top 10 Critical Bottlenecks
ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY
String-Based KOL Matching - Exact username matching fails with case/whitespace differences
Stale Scraped Data - Markets resolve using outdated data (up to 24h old)
Fragile String Parsing - 59 regex operations that break if format changes
Questionable Market Logic - top_rank_maintain and rank_flippening show incorrect outcomes
ðŸŸ  MEDIUM PRIORITY
Database Type Coercion - Decimal fields require manual parseFloat() conversion (already fixed threshold bug)
Missing Metadata Handling - Markets fail silently if metadata is missing
External API Dependencies - Twitter API required for follower growth markets
Puppeteer Scraping Reliability - Web scraping breaks when kolscan.io changes
ðŸŸ¡ LOW PRIORITY
Bet Settlement Race Conditions - No database transactions (partial settlements possible)
Silent Error Handling - Errors logged but default to "no" outcome
ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause of Your Current Issue
Your scraped KOL data is not fully accurate right now because:

Timing Gap: Scraper runs at 2 AM daily, but markets can resolve anytime (up to 22-hour stale data)
Manual Test Data: You manually inserted test data which doesn't reflect real kolscan.io
No Real-Time Validation: System doesn't verify data freshness before resolution
Username Matching Issues: Even with correct data, case/whitespace mismatches cause failures
Evidence:

We manually inserted: 'Sheep', '1', '42/8'
Real kolscan.io may have: 'sheep', '#1', '42 / 8'
These won't match â†’ Market resolves incorrectly
