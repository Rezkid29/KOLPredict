KolScan API ConnectionSuccessfully establish secure connection and authentication with the KolScan API. KOL Data FetchingImplement a service (or script) to retrieve a defined set of KOL profiles and initial metrics (followers, base engagement rate). Real-Time Data Refresh LogicImplement and test the logic for periodically pulling and updating KOL data to ensure it's "real-time." Data ModelingDefine the database schema (or data structure) for storing KOL profiles and their metrics (including historical data needed for predictions). Initial KOL Profile DisplayCreate a simple frontend view to display a list of KOLs with their key metrics from the fetched data.
Historical Data Preprocessing	Clean and structure historical KOL performance data (from KolScan) for use in statistical/AI models.
Baseline Statistical Model	Implement a basic statistical model (e.g., linear regression, moving average) to generate a baseline probability for simple outcomes (e.g., 'Will followers grow by > 5% this month?').
AI/ML Model Development	Develop and train an initial predictive model (AI/ML) to forecast KOL performance (e.g., engagement rate trajectory).
Odds Calculation Engine	Implement the core logic to convert the model's predicted probability ($\text{P}$) into betting odds (e.g., using a formula like $\text{Odds} = (1/\text{P}) - 1$).
Odds Display Integration	Integrate the generated odds with the frontend display, showing active markets for at least five KOLs.
 User Authentication & ProfilesImplement a secure user login/registration system and user profile storage. User Wallet Database SchemaDefine the database structure for the user wallet, including fields for balance, deposit/withdrawal history, and transaction IDs. Deposit/Withdrawal SimulationImplement and test basic functions to safely credit and debit the user's wallet (using simulated funds for the prototype). Bet Placement LogicImplement a backend service to validate a user's bet (check wallet balance, valid odds) and securely record the transaction. Payout & Settlement LogicCreate the core logic for settling a bet, determining the outcome, and calculating/crediting the correct payout to the winner's wallet.
 User Dashboard (Wallet View)Create a clean dashboard showing the user's current wallet balance, recent transactions, and active bets. KOL Betting Market InterfaceDesign a user-friendly interface to view a KOL's profile, available prediction markets, and current odds, with a clear "Place Bet" button. Bet Slip FunctionalityImplement the UI/UX for placing a bet: selecting an outcome, entering a stake, and seeing the potential payout before confirming. Leaderboard ViewImplement a view to show rankings for the top bettors (based on profit or success rate) and a ranking of KOLs (based on influence/growth). Social Sharing FeaturesAdd a simple feat=ure (like a button) to allow users to share their leaderboard rank or a placed bet on social media.
 Data Protection MeasuresImplement standard practices for hashing passwords and anonymizing sensitive user data, adhering to basic data privacy principles. Transaction Logging/AuditingEnsure all wallet transactions and bet placements are comprehensively logged for audit and dispute resolution. Input Validation & SanitizationImplement robust checks on all user input (stakes, usernames, etc.) to prevent common security vulnerabilities. Regulatory DisclaimerAdd a clear, non-negotiable legal/regulatory disclaimer visible on the site (e.g., "This is a simulated market for demonstration purposes only"). Agent Documentation & READMEEnsure the Replit Agent has generated a clean README.md and inline comments for easy understanding and future maintenance
